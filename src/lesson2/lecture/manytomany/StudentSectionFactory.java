	 * There are three scenarios:
	 * 1. A transcript entry for this student and section does not yet
	 * exist. In that case, a new one is created and the grade is
	 * inserted. The new transcript entry is added to the list of transcript
	 * entries belonging to the student and also to the section
	 * 2. A transcript entry already exists because it was added using
	 * a method to add a section for a student or to add a student to a section.
	 * In those cases, no grade has yet been assigned. In this case, a
	 * new transcript entry is not created, but the grade is inserted.
	 * 3. A transcript entry with this student and section already exists
	 * because a grade was already assigned; in this case, the grade is updated.
	 * 
	 * Note: if we do not forbid duplicate transcript entries, inconsistencies
	 * could arise. For instance, a student in a section could be assigned
	 * a grade and then later, by accident, a student could be added to the same
	 * section later on. It is possible in this case that, in searching
	 * for the grade for the student in that section, the transcript entry
	 * for this student/section that does not have a grade is the one that is found,
	 * and so it would appear that no grade was assigned. Another scenario
	 * would be that a grade for a student/section is assigned, but then later
	 * a new transcript entry might be created to change the grade. The result
	 * would be two transcript entries with the same student and section but with
	 * different grades.

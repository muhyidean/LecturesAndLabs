In this approach, Student "owns" the relationship, so
Student must be created first, and the 1-1 relationship
between Student and GradeReport can be established.

However, unless GradeReport constructor has reduced
visibility, it will still be possible to construct
a GradeReport first and violate the 1:1 requirement

  GradeReport r = new GradeReport(null);
  
To prevent this, GradeReport constructor has been
given only package level access

In this approach, an external class "owns" the relationship, so
instances of Student and GradeReport can be created and inserted
to each other under external management.

Management takes place in StudentGradeReportFactory
and shows in this case how the 1:1 relationship
can be created using 2 setters.

The 1:1 relationship cannot be broken by creating
instances of GradeReport or Student outside the factory
because their construcotrs have only package level access,
and the package contains only classes concerned with
this relationship.

Note that using two setters are not reliable if
it is necessary for a developer to remember to
perform the two set operations. However here,
the process of establishing the operation is
outside of developer control -- encapsulate in this
package.
